### Dynamic Parameter Adapter Configuration
####################

# Is dynamic parameter adapter enable. It's recommended for users to enable parameter adapter.
# The adapter can dynamically adjust the following two parameters according to the memory load of the system:
# 1. tsfile_size_threshold which is introduced below.
# 2. memtable_size_threshold which is introduced below.
# By dynamically adjusting these two parameters, the probability of system memory explosion is greatly reduced.
# When this parameter is set true, it will refuse to create time series or add storage groups under high system load.

# Note: If sys_dir is assigned an empty string(i.e.,zero-size), it will be handled as a relative path.
# For windows platform
# If its prefix is a drive specifier followed by "\\", or if its prefix is "\\\\", then the path is absolute. Otherwise, it is relative.

# The info of the three strategies are as follows:
# 1. SequenceStrategy: the system will choose the directory in sequence.
# 2. MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose disk has the maximum space.
# 3. MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy: the system will choose the directory whose folder has the minimum occupied space.
# Set SequenceStrategy,MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy and MinFolderOccupiedSpaceFirstStrategy to apply the corresponding strategy.
# If this property is unset, system will use MaxDiskUsableSpaceFirstStrategy as default strategy.
# For this property, fully-qualified class name (include package name) and simple class name are both acceptable.
